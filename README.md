# todo2Done

A Todo app built with Svelte, powered by [`create-svelte`](https://github.com/sveltejs/kit/tree/master/packages/create-svelte);

## About

todo2Done is a fun litle project I worked on to learn [`Svelte.js`](https://github.com/). One of the main challenges I had was working with Svelte Store. Took some time but I was able to get comfortable with it and get it to work for this project.
